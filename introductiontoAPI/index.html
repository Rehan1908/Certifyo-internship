A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is simply the “address” you type into your browser or use in your code to find something on the web. Here’s how it breaks down:

Scheme (Protocol):

Starts with http:// or https:// (secure).

Tells your browser or client how to talk to the server.

Host (Domain or IP):

The server’s name or address, e.g. api.example.com or 192.168.1.5.

Identifies where your request should go.

Port (Optional):

Follows the host with a colon, e.g. :3000.

Specifies the exact “door” on the server. If you omit it, 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) is assumed.

Path:

The specific resource on that server, e.g. /users/42.

Think of it as the folder and filename in a file system.

Query String (Optional):

Starts with ? and includes key-value pairs, e.g. ?search=alice&page=2.

Used to send extra parameters without changing the resource’s path.

Fragment (Optional):

Starts with #, e.g. #section3.

Points to a subsection of the document; it’s handled entirely by the browser and never sent to the server.


In web-APIs, the query string is the bit of the URL after the ?, made up of one or more key=value pairs separated by &. Express parses this for you into a plain JavaScript object on req.query. Here are the most common patterns you’ll see:

| Pattern             | Example URL                             | `req.query`                              | Usage (in code)                                                                    |   |                                                     |   |       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | --------------------------------------------------- | - | ----- |
| **Pagination**      | `/users?page=2&limit=25`                | `{ page: '2', limit: '25' }`             | \`const page = Number(req.query.page)                                              |   | 1;`<br>`const limit = Number(req.query.limit)       |   | 10;\` |
| **Filtering**       | `/products?category=books&inStock=true` | `{ category: 'books', inStock: 'true' }` | `const { category } = req.query;`<br>`const inStock = req.query.inStock==='true';` |   |                                                     |   |       |
| **Sorting**         | `/events?sortBy=date&order=desc`        | `{ sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc' }`      | `const sort = { [req.query.sortBy] : req.query.order==='desc' ? -1 : 1 };`         |   |                                                     |   |       |
| **Search**          | `/articles?search=express`              | `{ search: 'express' }`                  | \`const term = req.query.search                                                    |   | '';`<br>`db.find({ \$text: { \$search: term } });\` |   |       |
| **Field Selection** | `/users?fields=id,name,email`           | `{ fields: 'id,name,email' }`            | `const fields = req.query.fields.split(',');`<br>`db.find().select(fields);`       |   |                                                     |   |       |

What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter at a restaurant. Imagine you’re sitting at a table (your app) and you want to order food (some data or a service). You tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter goes to the kitchen (the server or another piece of software), fetches your order exactly the way you asked, and brings it back to you. You don’t need to know how the kitchen works or exactly how the chef prepares the dish—you just trust the waiter to handle all that.
Why it matters:

Simplicity: You ask for what you need without worrying about the details.

Consistency: The waiter always uses the same menu and ordering format, so you know exactly how to ask.

Safety: You can’t wander into the kitchen and break things—everything goes through the waiter’s well-defined processes.

 An API is a formally defined set of routines, protocols, and tools that enables one software component to request and exchange data or functionality with another. It abstracts the internal implementation details of a service, presenting a standardized interface through which clients can invoke operations and receive responses in prescribed formats (e.g., JSON or XML).

How do APIs relate to the internet as a whole?

Digital waiters across the web: Just like your restaurant waiter, APIs travel over the internet’s roads (HTTP requests) carrying your “order” (a request) to a distant kitchen, and then bring back the “meal” (a response, usually in JSON or XML format).

Building blocks of modern apps: Instead of every developer having to build a map system from scratch, they can use Google Maps’ API. Instead of coding your own payment gateway, you call Stripe’s API. This lets companies focus on their unique ideas—while relying on tried-and-tested services for common needs.

Scalability and interoperability: Because everyone agrees on the same ordering language (the API contract), different services and applications—no matter which programming language or platform they use—can talk to each other seamlessly over the internet.

 Across the Internet, APIs serve as the universally accepted mechanism by which disparate systems interoperate. Through standardized communication protocols (most commonly HTTP/HTTPS), clients transmit requests to remote servers and obtain structured responses. This model promotes modularity, reuse of established services (such as mapping, payment processing, or data storage), and secure, scalable integration among applications, irrespective of their underlying platforms or languages.

Early days (1950s–60s): Programmers defined simple function-calling rules inside mainframe operating systems—basically the first “local” APIs.

RPC & CORBA (1980s–90s): Remote Procedure Calls let programs on different machines call each other as if they were local functions.

SOAP & XML-RPC (late 1990s): Big companies like Microsoft and IBM standardized messaging formats so different systems could talk over the internet.

REST (2000): Roy Fielding popularized a simpler, URL-based style—now the most common way web APIs work.

Several key milestones made today’s APIs easy and powerful:

XML → JSON: JSON’s arrival (early 2000s) gave us a lightweight, human-readable data format that’s faster to parse than XML.

Cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services (2006), Google Cloud, and others turned core services (storage, compute, databases) into APIs anyone can call on demand.

API-first companies: Stripe (payments), Twilio (messaging), and SendGrid (email) built entire businesses around offering single-purpose, rock-solid APIs.

Developer tools: Tools like Postman (for testing), Swagger/OpenAPI (for documenting), and API gateways (for managing and securing) made it trivial to build, share, and scale APIs.

A RESTful API is like ordering from a café menu where every item has its own specific URL “address.” You use standard actions—like “GET” to look at a menu item, “POST” to place a new order, “PUT” to update your order, or “DELETE” to cancel it.

Resources as dishes: Each thing you want (a user’s profile, the list of today’s specials, a saved photo) lives at its own web address (URL).

Uniform requests: You always use the same basic verbs—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—so it’s super clear what action you’re asking for.

Stateless interaction: Every time you talk to the café (server), you include all the details needed in your request—no “memory” of your last visit. This keeps interactions predictable and easy to scale.

In short, a RESTful API is just a consistent, menu-style way for apps to ask web services for exactly what they want, using well-known HTTP commands.

What is Postman?
Postman is like a friendly remote control for talking to your API “waiter.” Instead of writing code every time to send requests, you use Postman’s visual interface to:

Set the address: Type in the API’s URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000/users).

Choose the action: Pick GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE from a dropdown—just like selecting a TV channel.

Add details: Enter any request headers (like content type) or body data (for POST/PUT) in simple text or form fields.

Send & inspect: Hit “Send” and instantly see the response status, headers, and body—no extra coding required.

This makes it super easy to explore your API, debug issues, and share collections of requests with teammates—without ever touching a command line.


GET

What it does: “Fetch me this.”

When to use: Retrieving data (e.g. a list of users, details of one user).

Idempotent: You can call it over and over without changing anything.

POST

What it does: “Create something new.”

When to use: Adding a new record (e.g. creating a new user, posting a comment).

Not idempotent: Calling it twice usually makes two items.

PUT

What it does: “Replace or update this entirely.”

When to use: Overwriting all fields of an existing item (e.g. editing a user’s name and email).

Idempotent: Doing it twice with the same data ends up in the same state.

DELETE

What it does: “Remove this.”

When to use: Deleting an existing item (e.g. removing a user).

Idempotent: Once it’s gone, repeating “delete” doesn’t change anything further.

Common Status Codes
| Code | Meaning               | When You’ll See It                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200  | OK                    | Everything went well; here’s your data.                                  |
| 201  | Created               | Your POST succeeded; a new resource was made.                            |
| 204  | No Content            | Your DELETE (or sometimes PUT) succeeded, but there’s no body to return. |
| 400  | Bad Request           | You sent something invalid (e.g. missing “name”).                        |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | You need to log in or supply credentials.                                |
| 403  | Forbidden             | You’re logged in but don’t have permission.                              |
| 404  | Not Found             | The thing you asked for doesn’t exist.                                   |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Oops—something went wrong on the server.                                 |


Error Handling In Express.
1. Built-in Defaults
If any route handler throws an error or calls next(err), Express will skip all normal routes and look for error-handling middleware (functions with signature (err, req, res, next)).

If you don’t define any, Express sends back a generic 500 Internal Server Error.


2. Synchronous Errors
Use throw or next(err) inside a route:


app.get("/danger", (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.query.token) {
    // create an Error and hand it off to Express
    const err = new Error("Token is required");
    err.status = 400;           // you can attach a status code
    return next(err);
  }
  // …normal processing…
});


3. Asynchronous Errors
In async functions or promise chains, wrap in try/catch or use a helper:
app.get("/async", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const data = await someAsyncOp();
    res.json(data);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);               // forward any thrown error
  }
});

4. Error-Handling Middleware
At the bottom of your middleware stack, add one or more handlers like this:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);            // log for debugging
  const status = err.status || 500;    // default to 500
  res.status(status).json({
    error: {
      message: err.message || "Oops! Something went wrong.",
      // you can include stack trace only in dev mode
      // stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? err.stack : undefined
    }
  });
});
Order matters: This must come after all your routes.

Multiple handlers: You can split logging vs. client response into separate middleware if you like.
