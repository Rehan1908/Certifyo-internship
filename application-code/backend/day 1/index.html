🌐 What is a Network?
A network is just a group of connected devices (like computers, phones, or servers) that can communicate with each other and share information.
just like a community where two or more people share information


What is the Internet: Imagine the internet like a big road system that connects computers all over the world. These computers can send and receive information through this system.
So the Internet is a like a network of networks.

💻 2. You (the Client) Make a Request
When you open a website (like Google or YouTube), your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) sends a request to that website’s computer, which is called a server.

🧠 Think of this like:

"Hey YouTube server, can you send me the homepage?"


🖥️ 3. The Server Responds
The server is like a smart computer that stores the website’s code and data. It gets your request and replies with the right content (HTML, images, videos, etc.).

🧠 Example:

You asked for YouTube's homepage → The server sends it back → Your browser shows it to you.


🗺️ 4. But How Does It Know Where to Send It?
Every computer connected to the internet has an IP address, which is like a home address.

You type www.google.com → the system finds the IP address of Google's servers → sends the request there.

This address finding is done by something called DNS (Domain Name System). 


HTTP stands for:

HyperText Transfer Protocol

It’s basically the language your browser and a server use to talk to each other over the internet.


Imagine you’re at a restaurant:

You (the browser) ask the waiter (HTTP) for a menu or food.

The waiter takes your request to the kitchen (server).

The kitchen makes the food and gives it to the waiter.

The waiter brings it back to you.

So, HTTP is like the waiter — it delivers your requests to the server and brings back the response.

there are 4 main types of requests:

GET → "Give me data" (e.g., load a webpage)

POST → "Send this data to the server" (e.g., when you log in)

PUT → "Update something"

DELETE → "Delete something"

 What about HTTPS?
That extra S means Secure.

HTTP = not encrypted (anyone can spy on it)

HTTPS = encrypted and safe 🔐 (used by banks, social media, etc.)

Servers respond using HTTP status codes — 3-digit numbers that tell your browser (or app) what happened with your request.

Let’s break them down simply:

📦 HTTP Status Code Categories
Each code starts with a number that means something:

Code Range	What It Means
1xx	📡 Info – Just letting you know
2xx	✅ Success – Everything went well
3xx	🔁 Redirect – Go somewhere else
4xx	❌ Client Error – You messed up 😅
5xx	💥 Server Error – Server messed up 😓

💯 Common Status Codes You Should Know
✅ 200 OK
Everything went fine.

Example: Page loaded successfully.

🆕 201 Created
Your data was saved successfully.

Example: You submitted a form to create an account.

❌ 400 Bad Request
You sent something wrong (like missing info).

🔑 401 Unauthorized
You need to log in first.

🚫 403 Forbidden
You're not allowed to access this.

❓ 404 Not Found
The page doesn’t exist.

(The classic “404 Page Not Found”)

💣 500 Internal Server Error
Server crashed or something broke.

It’s not your fault.

🛠️ 503 Service Unavailable
Server is too busy or down for maintenance.


🌐 What Are Browsers?
A browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is an app that lets you visit websites and interact with them.

But under the hood, it does a lot of work:

🛠️ How Browsers Work (Simple Breakdown)
Let’s say you type https://www.google.com in your browser:

1. DNS Lookup
Browser asks:

"What’s the IP address of google.com?"

DNS gives the IP address.

2. HTTP Request
Browser sends:

"Hey server at that IP, send me the homepage!"
(using HTTP or HTTPS)

3. Server Response
Server replies with:

HTML (structure of page)

CSS (styling)

JS (interactive behavior)

4. Rendering the Page
Browser:

Reads the HTML and builds the page

Applies CSS for design

Runs JavaScript (in the browser!) to make things dynamic

Frontend vs Backend — What’s the Difference?
Frontend:
This is what you see and interact with on your browser — buttons, images, text, animations.
The browser runs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show this.

Backend:
This is the “behind-the-scenes” part on a server somewhere on the internet.
It handles requests, works with databases, does calculations, and sends data back to the frontend.

 Why Do We Need Backend?
Imagine a website like Instagram:

When you open Instagram, your browser asks the server for photos.

The server (backend) looks into the database, finds your friends’ photos, and sends them back.

The browser shows those photos to you.

Without backend:

No way to store your data

No way to save your profile or posts

No dynamic content, just static pages

When your browser sends an HTTP request (like “GET me the homepage” or “POST my login info”), the backend:

Receives the request

Processes it (check if you’re logged in, save data, fetch info)

Talks to a database if needed (like MySQL, MongoDB)

Sends back a response (data, confirmation, error message)

Node.js lets you write backend code using JavaScript — the same language you use on the frontend.

You can create a server that listens for HTTP requests and sends responses.

This server can handle things like user login, serving pages, saving data, and more.

javascript can only run in the browser.

Node.js Changed that as it can run JavaScript without a browser. So it is a JavaScript runtime environment. Without a runtime environment, your code wouldn’t know how to interact with the computer’s hardware or operating system. It ensures your program behaves consistently across different systems. SO it is like a bridge between your Operating system and the language itself.

Node.js is like a fork of google chromes engine (v8) but it runs in your computer. It is different from the browser as there is no DOM no HTML, CSS, the output is there only in the terminal

So it is Not a new language it is Just JavaScript 90%.


// Import the http module
const http = require('http');

// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response header to plain text
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  
  // Send the response body
  res.end('Hello, Rehan! Welcome to your backend.');
});

// Listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});
